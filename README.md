# C2ClientnServer
A golang Server and c++ client for system administration

I'm trying with this to make a small Management Software for my at home Servers

A simple C# WPF Gui for Reading and Sending Commands laying on the main Server

The Client is a basic C++ Program which translates the (very simple and basic calls to a console process and relays them back to the host)
